#+STARTUP: content

* Overview

Scientific Research Timeline creates an interactive, browser-based timeline of your scientific documents, allowing you to visualize historical context, filter by research tags, and seamlessly navigate between your timeline and your text editor.

It is designed for researchers, academics, and scientists who need to see *when* their research happened, not just how it links together.

* Installation

**Use-package**

Using ~use-package~ (Recommended). You should add something like this to your ~init.el~, these are the keybindings that I find useful, but feel free to change them.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

(use-package scientific-research-timeline
       :after scientific-mapping
       :bind (("C-c n p" . scientific-research-timeline-open)       ; Open the Timeline View
              ("C-c n d" . scientific-research-timeline-add-date)   ; Add/Edit Timeline Date
              ("C-c n s" . scientific-research-timeline-show-node)  ; Force Show Node in Browser
      	      ("C-c n h" . scientific-research-timeline-hide-node)  ; Force Hide Node in Browser
              ("C-c n t" . scientific-research-timeline-tag-add)    ; Add Tag (Smart Completion)
 	      ("C-c n z" . scientific-research-timeline-zoom-date)  ; Focus the view on a specified date
      	 )
       
       ;; Default zoom range (years) when focusing a single point
       (scientific-research-timeline-focus-window-years 5)

       ;; Start with connection lines enabled?
       (scientific-research-timeline-show-links-on-start t)

       ;; Enable "Follow Me" mode by default? (Timeline tracks your cursor)
       (scientific-research-timeline-follow-mode-on-start t)

       ;; Disable the minibuffer with note content in the UI
       (scientific-research-timeline-preview-on-start nil)
       
       :config
       (message "Scientific Research Timeline loaded."))
#+END_SRC

**Manual Installation**

Clone this repository and add the following to your ~init.el~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/scientific-research-timeline")
(require 'scientific-research-timeline)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

**Basic Usage**

1. Add timeline dates to your scientific documents using ~scientific-research-timeline-add-date~
2. Open the timeline with ~scientific-research-timeline-open~
3. Navigate through your research chronology
4. Click on nodes to open them in Emacs

**Timeline Properties**

To add timeline information to your scientific documents, add these properties:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:PROPERTIES:
:TIMELINE_START: 2023-01-15
:TIMELINE_END: 2023-06-30
:END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

- ~TIMELINE_START~: When the research/project began (required)
- ~TIMELINE_END~: When the research/project ended (optional, for ranges)

**Supported Date Formats**

- ~YYYY-MM-DD~ (e.g., 2023-01-15)
- ~YYYY-MM~ (e.g., 2023-01) - interpreted as first day of month
- ~YYYY~ (e.g., 2023) - interpreted as January 1st of that year

The timeline automatically updates when:

- New scientific documents are created
- Publication dates are added
- Research tags are modified
- Citation relationships change

**Research Workflow Integration**

4. *Visualize Impact*: See citation networks over time
5. *Navigate Chronology*: Jump between research phases

**Citation Database Integration**

Timeline integrates with citation-database to show:

- Publication dates from DOI metadata
- Citation relationships over time
- Research impact metrics
- Co-citation patterns

- *Timeline Export*: Save timeline as image or data
- *Research Reports*: Generate chronological research summaries
- *Collaboration*: Share timeline views with research teams

* Troubleshooting

**Timeline Not Loading**

*Problem*: Timeline doesn't open in browser
*Solution*:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Check if scientific-research-timeline-mode is enabled
(scientific-mapping-mode 1)

;; Verify web server is running
(scientific-research-timeline-open)
#+END_SRC

**Dates Not Appearing**

*Problem*: Research dates not showing in timeline
*Solution*:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Add timeline properties to document
M-x scientific-research-timeline-add-date

;; Or manually add properties:
:PROPERTIES:
:TIMELINE_START: 2023-01-15
:END:
#+END_SRC

**Performance Issues**

*Problem*: Timeline slow with many documents
*Solution*:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Reduce zoom window
(setq scientific-research-timeline-focus-window-years 2)

;; Disable connection lines
(setq scientific-research-timeline-show-links-on-start nil)
#+END_SRC
